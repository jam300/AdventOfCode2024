# AdventOfCode2024

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges. The solutions are implemented in **C++**, organized by day (e.g., Day2, Day3, etc.) and each folder contains the code for that specific day's puzzle.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that runs every December, where participants solve daily puzzles that progressively increase in difficulty.

## Status
I started working on these challenges but due to personal reasons, I have not completed all of them yet. However, I plan to finish all puzzles before the end of 2025.

## Languages & Tools
- **C++ (100%)**
- **Git for version control**

## Notes
- Feel free to explore, clone, or contribute!
- More solutions will be added progressively.
